### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned to be very careful with your spelling. Missing a "T" in the word Transportation caused havoc.
2. As long as you follwed the same rules for each variable it worked perfectly
3. I thought the document.getElementById command is fantastic at what it can do.
